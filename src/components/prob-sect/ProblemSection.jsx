          <strong>
            Most of us don't wear 70%-80% of our clothes - yet we keep buying more.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          With households spending around $300 monthly on clothing (Statistics
          Canada), our closets have become expensive graveyards of barely-worn
          pieces. Then, when our closets overflow, we simply throw clothes away.
          On average, a Canadian throws away 81 pounds of textiles every year â€“
          that's equivalent to 27 t-shirts, 16 jeans, 18 jackets, 18 dresses and
          18 sweaters heading straight to landfills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those unworn clothes are a waste of money. But it does not have to be that way. Dressing well can be fun, creative and financially friendly.
